# Post-Release Activities Guide

This guide outlines the activities to conduct after a successful release of the Vibing AI SDK. These steps help ensure the release is properly monitored, supported, and built upon for future development.

## 1. Immediate Post-Release Monitoring

### Monitor npm Download Statistics

```bash
# Check npm download statistics
npm view @vibing-ai/sdk downloads
```

- Monitor downloads in the first 24-48 hours
- Compare with previous release adoption rates
- Document any significant changes in adoption pattern

### Watch for GitHub Issues

```bash
# Set up notifications for new issues
open https://github.com/vibing-ai/sdk/issues
```

- Configure notifications for new issues
- Assign team members to monitor issues during the critical post-release period
- Prioritize issues related to the new release

### Check Social Media for Feedback

Actively monitor:
- Twitter mentions and hashtags
- LinkedIn comments and shares
- Reddit discussions in relevant subreddits
- Discord channels
- Stack Overflow questions

Document feedback themes and sentiments for the retrospective.

### Monitor Support Channels

```bash
# Check support email
open https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#label/vibing-sdk-support

# Check support forum
open https://community.vibing.ai/c/sdk-support
```

- Respond to support requests promptly
- Document common questions for FAQ updates
- Identify trending issues for potential hotfixes

### Watch for Unexpected Behavior

```bash
# Check error tracking system
open https://sentry.io/organizations/vibing-ai/sdk

# Check performance monitoring
open https://dashboard.vibing.ai/sdk/performance
```

- Monitor error rates compared to pre-release
- Watch for new error types or patterns
- Track performance metrics for regressions
- Set up alerts for critical issues

## 2. Hotfix Protocol

### Criteria for Emergency Fixes

A hotfix should be considered when:
- A critical security vulnerability is discovered
- A severe regression breaks core functionality
- Data integrity issues are present
- Authentication or authorization bypasses are discovered
- Installation failures affect a significant percentage of users

### Process for Releasing Hotfixes

1. **Triage the Issue**
   - Confirm severity and impact
   - Document steps to reproduce
   - Identify affected versions

2. **Develop and Test the Fix**
   ```bash
   # Create a hotfix branch from the release tag
   git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.4 v1.2.3
   
   # Implement the fix and commit
   git add [files]
   git commit -m "fix: description of the issue"
   
   # Run comprehensive tests
   npm test
   ```

3. **Release the Hotfix**
   ```bash
   # Update version (patch)
   npm version patch --no-git-tag-version
   
   # Update CHANGELOG.md
   code CHANGELOG.md
   
   # Commit version bump
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: release v1.2.4"
   
   # Create tag
   git tag -a v1.2.4 -m "v1.2.4 - Hotfix for [issue]"
   
   # Build and publish
   npm run build
   npm publish --access public
   
   # Push changes
   git push origin hotfix-1.2.4
   git push origin v1.2.4
   ```

4. **Communicate the Hotfix**
   - Create GitHub release
   - Send notification to affected users
   - Update documentation

### Communication Templates for Issues

Create templates for:
- Initial acknowledgment
- Status updates
- Fix announcement
- Post-mortem report

Store these in `docs/maintainers/templates/`.

### Rollback Procedures

If a hotfix causes further issues:

```bash
# Revert to the previous version
npm unpublish @vibing-ai/sdk@1.2.4
npm dist-tag add @vibing-ai/sdk@1.2.3 latest

# Notify users
# [Use emergency communication channels]
```

Document in the post-mortem and develop a new fix with more thorough testing.

### Security Issue Handling

For security vulnerabilities:
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Follow responsible disclosure timeline
3. Prepare fix privately
4. Coordinate release with vulnerability report
5. Issue CVE if applicable

## 3. Feedback Collection

### How to Collect and Organize Feedback

```bash
# Create a feedback collection issue
open https://github.com/vibing-ai/sdk/issues/new
```

- Create a dedicated feedback collection issue for the release
- Categorize feedback into:
  - Bug reports

- Support satisfaction
- Future feature priorities

Send to users 1-2 weeks after release.

### Usage Data Analysis

If telemetry is enabled:
```bash
# Access telemetry dashboard
open https://analytics.vibing.ai/sdk/v1.2.3
```

Analyze:
- Feature adoption rates
- Error patterns
- Performance metrics
- User workflows
- Compatibility issues

### Community Sentiment Monitoring

Track sentiment across:
- GitHub discussions
- Social media mentions
- Community forum posts
- Direct feedback

Document sentiment trends and significant feedback.

### Feature Request Aggregation
