# Support Guide for Maintainers

This guide is intended for maintainers of the Vibing AI SDK and outlines the processes for handling support requests, issues, and community interactions.

## Issue Triage Process

### 1. Initial Assessment (24-48 hours)

When a new issue is created:

1. **Acknowledge receipt**: Add a comment thanking the user for reporting and confirming that we're looking into it
2. **Apply appropriate labels**:
   - Type: `bug`, `feature`, `question`, `documentation`
   - Priority: `p0` (critical), `p1` (high), `p2` (medium), `p3` (low)
   - Status: `triage`, `investigating`, `needs-info`, `in-progress`, `resolved`
   - Area: `app`, `plugin`, `agent`, `memory`, `surface`, `core`, etc.
3. **Initial validation**: Verify that the issue contains sufficient information
4. **Check for duplicates**: Search for and link to any related or duplicate issues

### 2. Issue Evaluation

Evaluate issues based on:

- **Severity** - Impact on users and business
- **Scope** - How many users affected
- **Reproducibility** - Can it be consistently reproduced
- **Workarounds** - Are there viable workarounds

### 3. Prioritization Matrix

| Severity | Scope | Priority | Target Response | Target Resolution |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Wide | P0 | Same day | 1-2 days |
| Critical | Limited | P1 | 1 day | 2-3 days |
| Major | Wide | P1 | 1 day | 1 week |
| Major | Limited | P2 | 2 days | 2 weeks |
| Minor | Wide | P2 | 2 days | Next release |
| Minor | Limited | P3 | 1 week | Backlog |

## Response Templates

## Severity Classification Guidelines

### Critical (P0)
- Service is unavailable or unusable for all users
- Security vulnerability with active exploitation
- Data loss or corruption
- SDK cannot be installed or initialized

### High (P1)
- Core functionality broken for many users
- Performance degradation affecting many users
- Security vulnerability without known exploitation
- Important API functioning incorrectly

### Medium (P2)
- Non-core functionality issues
- Unexpected behavior with workarounds
- UI/UX issues that don't prevent functionality
- Documentation gaps for important features

### Low (P3)
- Minor bugs with easy workarounds
- Cosmetic issues
- Documentation improvements
- Feature enhancement requests

## Resolution Workflow

1. **Assignment**: Assign the issue to the appropriate team member
2. **Investigation**: Reproduce the issue and determine root cause
3. **Solution Planning**: Document proposed solution and timeline
4. **Implementation**: Create a fix and internal testing
5. **Review**: Code review and QA testing
6. **Release Planning**: Determine release vehicle (hotfix or regular release)
7. **Communication**: Update the issue with resolution details
8. **Verification**: Confirm with the reporter that the issue is resolved
9. **Close**: Close the issue with appropriate closing comments

## Escalation Process

Issues should be escalated when:

1. **Critical impact**: Issue affects a large number of users or a major customer
2. **Stalled resolution**: Issue has been open for >2 weeks without progress
3. **Technical complexity**: Issue requires cross-team expertise
4. **Uncertainty**: Unclear how to proceed with resolution

Escalation Path:
1. Team Lead
2. Engineering Manager
3. Product Manager
4. CTO (for critical issues only)

## User Communication

### Principles
- Be transparent about timelines
- Set realistic expectations
- Provide workarounds when possible
- Keep users updated on progress
- Thank users for their patience and input

### Update Frequency
- P0: Daily updates
- P1: Twice weekly updates
- P2: Weekly updates
- P3: Updates on status change

## Community Management

### Community Interaction Guidelines
- Always be respectful and professional
- Assume good intentions
- Focus on the technical issue, not the person
- Recognize and acknowledge contributions
- Set clear boundaries when necessary

### Handling Difficult Interactions
1. Stay factual and solution-oriented
2. Do not engage with hostile comments
3. Refer to the code of conduct when necessary
4. Involve team leads for moderation if needed
5. Take discussions private when they become unproductive

### Recognition Program
- Thank users for high-quality bug reports
- Acknowledge users who suggest implemented features
- Consider featuring community contributions in release notes
- Identify potential contributors for more involvement

## Support Metrics Tracking

Track the following metrics:
- Time to first response
- Time to resolution
- Issue reopening rate
- User satisfaction with support
- Number of issues by category
- Resolution rate by week/month

Review these metrics monthly to identify improvement opportunities.

## Continuous Improvement

- Hold monthly retrospectives on support challenges
- Update this guide based on learnings
- Identify common issues for documentation improvements
- Create templates for common issues
- Automate routine support tasks when possible
