# Vibing AI SDK Cookbook

Welcome to the Vibing AI SDK Cookbook! This collection of practical recipes helps you solve common tasks and implement best practices when building with the Vibing AI SDK.

## What is the Cookbook?

The cookbook provides concrete, copy-paste ready solutions for specific tasks. Each recipe is focused on solving a single problem with complete, working code examples. Unlike the guides which explain concepts, the cookbook shows you exactly how to implement specific features and solve common challenges.

## How to Use This Cookbook

1. **Browse by category** - Recipes are organized into categories based on the type of task:
   - [Apps](./apps/) - Recipes for building applications
   - [Plugins](./plugins/) - Recipes for creating plugins
   - [Agents](./agents/) - Recipes for developing agents
   - [General](./general/) - Cross-cutting recipes for common tasks

2. **Find solutions to specific problems** - Each recipe addresses a specific problem with a complete solution.

3. **Copy and adapt** - The code samples are designed to be copied and adapted to your specific needs.

## Recipe Format

Each recipe follows a consistent format:

1. **Problem Statement** - A clear description of the problem being solved
2. **Solution** - A concise explanation of the approach
3. **Implementation** - Step-by-step instructions with code
4. **Usage Example** - A complete, working example
5. **Variations** - Common variations or extensions (when applicable)
6. **Related Recipes** - Links to related recipes (when applicable)

## Contributing to the Cookbook

We welcome contributions to the cookbook! If you have a solution to a common problem or a useful pattern, please consider sharing it.

To contribute a recipe:

1. Follow the standard recipe format above
2. Place it in the appropriate category folder
3. Add a link to it in this README
4. Submit a pull request

Each recipe should be practical, focused on a specific problem, and include complete, working code.

## Best Practices for Following Recipes

- Understand the recipe before implementing it - don't just copy and paste blindly
- Adapt the recipe to your specific requirements
- Test thoroughly after implementation
- Combine recipes when needed to solve more complex problems
- Reference the API documentation for more details on the functions and methods used
